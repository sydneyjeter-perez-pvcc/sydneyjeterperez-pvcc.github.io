                <h2> About </h2>
                <p> The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) is a federal agency under the Department of Defence that plays an important role in a vast range of engineering and construction projects across the nation. As one of the oldest engineering organizations in the United States, established in 1775, its evolution has been significant over the years.</p>
                <p> The USACE is known best for its work in civil engineering, specifically navigation, environmental restoration, and flood risk management. However they manage an expanding network of dams, levees, and reservoirs, providing flood control and water supply to the many people of America. In addition to these other tasks, this agency also oversees the maintenance of navigable waterways, which ensure that shipping lanes and ports can be accessed for use. </p>
                    
                <p>Lastly, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has a significant presence in disaster response and recovery. They help provide technical assistance, debris removal, and the rebuilding of essential infrastructures which is very beneficial to areas recovering from natural disasters like hurricanes, earthquakes, and more. </p>
                    
                <p> The USACE does not contain just military personnel but also civilians. This group contains both engineers, project managers, and scientists. Together, this group has used advanced technologies such as drones and geographic information systems to ensure efficient and proper work. </p>
                    

                <h2> History </h2>
                <p> History of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dates all the way back to 1775 when the Continental Congress constructed an army with a chief engineer and two assistants. However, it wasn’t until 1802 that this organization became what it is today. There was some debate over time about what the politicians wanted the Corps to contribute to, including military construction and works “of a civil nature”. The first Chief Engineer was Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan Williams, who focused on developing the nation's military engineering capabilities. Throughout U.S. history, the Corps have had numerous roles in many military campaigns including the War of 1812, the Mexican-American War, and World War I. These engineers were essential for the construction of bridges, the layout of military defenses, and mapping. </p>
                    
                <p> The 19th century is where the duties of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers truly expanded beyond military engineering. After the Civil War, civil projects were in the works, which included flood control and infrastructure management. What really sealed the tasks of the Corps down was the Flood Control Act of 1936 which formalized their roles in managing and evolving the United State’s waterways. </p>
                    
                <p> Another notable project of this organization was the passage of the Water Resources Development Act of 1986, aka WRDA 86. This law brought to light the importance of water resources planning and stated that environmental considerations were necessary to water resource planning. This gained the Corps better funding and gave the government a better understanding of the importance of keeping our resources efficient, stable, and up-to-date. This law also brought a significant amount of policy changes that revised cost-sharing requirements of various waterways including taxes to maintain harbors and taxes to support inland lock and dam projects. </p>

                <p>In the later half of the 20th century the Corps became more involved in environmental management and conservational efforts that included responding to public concerns about ecological impacts. Some noteworthy projects include restoring wetlands and the improvement of water quality. </p>

                <p> In the present, the USACE holds a vast amount of responsibilities that include flood risk management, ecosystem restoration, and emergency response. There has also been international work done in engineering projects as well as humanitarian efforts and infrastructure development in third world countries. Overall, the Corps first started out as a group of engineers ready to aid in infrastructural development needed for military campaigns and has evolved to cover many important bases such as environmental and waterway maintenance and development. </p>
